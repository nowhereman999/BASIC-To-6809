V$ = "4.37"
'       - Added TRIM$,LTRIM$ & RTRIM$ commands that will remove the spaces in a string
'       - Fixed a bug where the IRQ wasn't being set properly if you used PLAY and a CoCo 3 GMODE

' V 4.36
'       - Added command CPUSPEED # where # is 1 for .895 Mhz, 2 for 1.79 Mhz, 3 for 2.8636 MHz and anything else will
'         set the speed to max for that computer's hardware.  Which also will put a 6309 in native mode.
'       - Added command COPYBLOCKS, which copies 8k blocks using stack blasting useful for CoCo3 copying from buffer 0 to buffer 1
'       - Fix a bug with deep IF/THEN/ELSE layers that could exit to the wrong location
'       - Tweaked the DIV16 & DIV16Rounding code so that the resulting value in D will be reflected in the condition codes when exiting the
'         routine

' V 4.35
'       - Fixed a problem with handling DATA statements that had many comma's in a row like (DATA "THIS",,,2,,)

' V 4.34
'       - Can now handle 10000 IF/THEN/ELSE commands per program, was previously set at 100
'       - Fixed a bug detecting string array variables
'       - Made STRING$ function now handle ascii codes instead of only string values for the 2nd value in the command
'       - Fixed a bug with MID$
'       - can now handle 1000 deep expression comparisons, was limited to 10 previously
'       - Fixed a bug with IF/THEN/ELSE where compiler could re-use the same labels
'       - Fixed a bug with numeric arrays with one element (wasn't pointing at the correct RAM location)
'       - Fixed a bug with the SDC_GETCURDIR$ command
'       - Fixed a bug with the PLAY command (IRQ was returning to the wrong location)
'       - PLAY command now automatically plays at normal speed then automatically speeds up the CoCo after playing

' V 4.33
'       - If your CoCo 3 can support 2.8 Mhz high speed the compiled code now runs at triple speed (2.8 Mhz)
'         for most operations (not disk, etc.)

' V 4.32
'       - Added new command SDC_BIGLOADM, for fast loading the CoCo 3 memory banks, useful for loading game backgrounds or
'         Other large amounts for data
'       - Added support for Drive number 0 or 1 for the SDC_Play commands

' V 4.31
'       - Fixed a bug in the SDC_LOADM command that wasn't loading from drive # 0 properly

' V4.30
'       - Fixed a couple bugs with the LOADM command (wasn't finding the last granule properly if the file used granules beyond $40)

' V4.29
'       - Added support for the NTSC composite video out modes (256 colours) for the CoCo3, these are new GMODE values from 160 to 165 - See the updated manual for more info
'       - Added new command NTSC_FONTCOLOURS b,f to set the background and foreground colours of the fonts used with the new NTSC composite output GMODEs

' V4.25
'       - Fixed a bug with with using numeric commands like RNDZ(x) before an close bracket of a graphics command like SET(x,y,RNDZ(3))

' V4.24
'       - Fixed a bug in the compiler when it was assigning the value of an equation to a variable.  If the equation didn't have a
'         variable and it was doing AND, OR, XOR or MOD it was not setting the variable properly.  It also wasn't handling HEX values
'         properly in this same routine.

' V4.23
'       - Made the Tokenizer a little more robust, it now detects array names better if there aren't spaces before the array name and
'         the array is being used in an equation.

' V4.22
'       - Fixed a bug with large BASIC programs especially if it used a large amount of space for the ADDASSEM: section

' V4.21
'       - Fixed a bug where the PROGRAM start was not being setup to the correct address when GMODE was being used.  Thanks to
'         Tazman (Scott Cooper) for finding the bug.

' V4.20
'       - Fixed a bug in GMODE 1 graphic commands (This mode only supprts two colours, not 9 like GMODE 0)
'       - Added printing to the screen using the semi-graphic modes, the sime graphics modes use the built in VDG font except for GMODE 4
'       - which uses SG6 and the built in fonts aren't supported in the this mode.  So the font that is shown is a large 6x6 matrix font.
'       - Now every GMODE can now print text on the screen using LOCATE x,y:PRINT #-3,"Hello World"

' V4.11
'       - Can now handle MID$(String,Start) which will copy the String starting at location Start copying the rest of the string.  It no
'         longer needs to be MID$(String,Start,Length).

' V4.10 - Added text fonts that can be used directly in any graphics mode, use LOCATE x,y and PRINT #-3,"Hello World" to print
'         to the graphics screen.  You must select the font using the -f option.  The font names end with _Bx_Fx where Bx is the Background
'         colour and Fx is the Foreground colour. Example: -fCoCoT1_B0_F2
'       - Can now put compiler options on the first line of the program using ' CompilerOptins:
'         Example first line of your program: ' CompileOptions: -fArcade_B0_F1 -o -s32
'
' V4.03 - Fixed a bug in the GCOPY command
'       - Tweaked the code for the GMODE command

' V4.02 - Numeric array sizes can now be larger than 255, so it will now accept DIM A(1000) or DIM MyArray(300,2,2)
'       - String array sizes can now be larger than 255, so it will now accept DIM A$(1000) or DIM MyArray$(300,2), the default size for strings (which includes array elements)
'         is 255 therefore you must use the compiler option -sxxx where xxx is the size of the string and make it a smaller string size if you are going to use many string arrays
'
' V4.01 - With the GMODE ModeNumber,GraphicsPage the compiler can now handle variables for the GraphicsPage value.  The ModeNumber value will always need to be an actual number
'       - Palette command now will wait for a vsync to change the value (should make sure there's no sparkels)
'
' V4.00 - Added New command GMODE which allows you to easily select every graphic mode the CoCo 1,2 or 3 can produce
'       - Added New command GCOPY which allows you to copy graphic pages to other graphic pages
'       - Tweaked LINE, CIRCLE & PAINT commands to use all the available graphic modes and colours of the CoCo 1,2 or 3
'
' V3.03 - Tweaked the AND, OR, XOR commands as the optimizer was not handling them properly
'
' V3.02 - Fixed a bug with optimiing when it is doing exponents
'       - Fixed a bug with optimiing when it is doing exponents
'
' V3.01 - Fixed a small bug with Printing of double quotes ""
'
' V3.00 - Added SDC file support, you can now read and write files on the SDC filesystem directly
'       - If a 6309 is present it puts it in native mode (should speed up code about 15%)
'       - Added compiler option -a which makes your program autostart
'       - Fixed a bug where if a variable name had AND,OR,MOD,XOR,NOT or DIVR in the name it would create variable names and operators out of it
'       - Fixed a bug with IF command with multiple numeric commands that weren't evaluating properly
'
' V2.22 - Fixed a bug with a comment at the end of a DATA statement, it was sometimes not being ignored
'
' V2.21 - Fixed bug with close brackets
'
' V2.20 - Fixed handling of direct number conversion of a number that starts with a minus sign
'       - Fixed handling of DATA values that start with a minus sign
'       - Matched how BASIC converts a float to an INT (negative numbers always get the integer -1)
'       - Fixed a bug in multidimensional arrays
'
' V2.19 - Fixed LINE-(x,y),PSET command, so it will work properly

' V2.18 - Fixed assignning a variable to numeric commands
'
' V2.17 - Added CMPNE(FP_A,FP_B) - Floating Point Compare if Not Equal
'
' V2.16 - Found a problem with comparing floating point numbers where the exponent was not being compared correctly
'       - Tweaked getting the 2nd value in a floatting point number if it was a typed value
'       - Tweaked getting numeric value in as a floating point number can now handle the value if it starts with a decimal
'       - Tweaked the identification of a label and a variable
'
' V2.15 - Aadding limited Floating point operations
'       - Fixed a bug compiling single lines with IF THEN ELSE
'
' V2.14 - Added more commands for streaming audio directly off the CoCoSDC: SDCPLAYORCS, SDCPLAYORCL & SDCPLAYORCR
'         These commands require either an Orchestra 90 or CocoFLASH (https://www.go4retro.com/products/cocoflash/) cartridge
'         The SDCPLAYORCS command streams stereo 8 bit unsigned audio at 22,375hz to both the left and right channels
'         The SDCPLAYORCL streams mono 8 bit unsigned audio at 44,750hz to the Left channel output
'         The SDCPLAYORCR streams mono 8 bit unsigned audio at 44,750hz to the Right channel output
'       - Added version checking if the user is going to have SDC streaming commands like SDCPLAY as the SDC needs version 127 or higher
'       - Fixed handling of REM's that were commenting out actual code, it now display better in the .asm file
'         It was also causing errors as some of the command values were printing as ASCII LF/BREAK/Carriage return symbols
'
' V2.13 - Added command PLAYSDC"SAMPLE.RAW" which will play the sample stored on the SDC through the CoCo DAC
'
' V2.12 - Added GET and PUT commands, added option for PUT command to use the usual PSET (default), PRESET, AND, OR, NOT but also added XOR
'
' V2.11 - Tweaked PLAY command to handle quoted strings a little better.
'
' V2.10 - Added PLAY command and tweaked DRAW command so it handles ;X with a string if the DRAW command doesn't end with a semi colon
'       - Fixed a NASTY bug where certain bytes in ADDASSEM/ENDASSEM would write over actual program code
'
' V2.09 - Fixed a bug with INKEY$
'
' V2.08 - Broke some regular printing with the printing to graphics screen, this is now been fixed
'       - Fixed a bug with getting the value of an expression before an open bracket if an array was before the open bracket
'
' V2.07 - Fixed problem with REM or ' at the end of a line, was causing that entire line to be ignored especially if it started with a variable
'
' V2.06 - Fixed a bug where the compiler needed a space after the PRINT command and before the # sign as PRINT#-2 or PRINT#-1 would give an error.
'       - Added support of PRINT#-3, which prints text to the PMODE 4 screen
'       - Changed the LOCATE x,y command so it will position the PRINT #-3, cursor location on the PMODE 4 screen where x is from 0 to 31 and y is from 0 to 184
'       - Added a new commandline option -f[fontname] where the user can supply the font name to use for printing to the graphics screen.  The font must be in the folder
'         Basic_Includes/Graphic_Screen_Fonts
'         Arcade & CoCoT1 with Arcade being the default font as it is a bolder font and less likely to artifact.  The CoCoT1 font is a pixel accurate version
'         of the CoCo's 6847 T1 VDG chip.  The fonts are already compiled sprites to make them print as fast as possible.
'
' V2.05 - Added printing to serial port with Print #-2,
'
' Things to do:
' - Add more commands (look through CoCo Extended basic book)
' - Change variables for graphics programs so they use faster/DP RAM
' - Make the program handle array sizes intellegently, arrays of 254 or less will use the current array method, larger arrays will use 16 bit values like A(1050) or A(700,3)
' - Make draw's destination address the same as the LINE destination address so they can continue where each left off
' - Make PSET take a colour value
' - Add more grpahics resolution handling like PMODE 1,2 & 3
