; SDC Version Number - Command
;
; Returns the firmware’s version number as a 16-bit BCD value. Versions prior to 113 did not support this
; command and will fail with status bit 7 set. This is useful for determining if a particular command or feature is
; available. 
;
; Version History table:
; 113 Added the VERSION command.
; 115 Added the DELETE, RENAME and QUERY DISK SIZE commands as well as the ability to recognize
;     Dragon VDK images (but only with a 12-byte header).
; 116 Fixed the recognition of Dragon VDK headers to include headers up to 256 bytes in length.
; 117 Added the STREAM command.
; 120 Added the MOUNT NEXT DISK command. It also fixed the QUERY DISK SIZE command. Prior
;     versions only returned a 16-bit value rather than a 24-bit value (FF49 was always returning 0).
; 124 Introduced the MOUNT DISK # command and the 8-bit option for WRITE SECTOR.
; 127 Added ability to stream small files using the m: command
;
; A = $C0
; B = $56  (V)
; U = Buffer address to retrieve info to
;
; Put controller in Command mode:
; This changes the mode the CoCo SDC work in.  It is now ready for direct communication
