; SDCPLAYORCS command - Play audio sample through the Orchestra 90/CoCo Flash
; Stereo output at 22,375 khz sample rate
; Play a raw audio sample directly from the CoCoSDC
; filename is at _StrVar_PF00 and terminated with a zero
; Will use RAM from _StrVar_PF00 to _StrVar_IFRight+256 as two 512 byte RAM buffers
; Extra space (256 bytes) must be reserved after _StrVar_IFRight (which the compiler will take care of)
;
*****************************************************
* To convert audio to CoCo 1 & 2 SDCPLAY mode at 22375 hz use ffmpeg:
* ffmpeg -i source_audio.wav -acodec pcm_u8 -f u8 -ac 2 -ar 22375 -af aresample=22375:filter_size=256:cutoff=1.0 output.raw
* Batch conversion of .wav files to CoCo .raw:
* for f in *.wav ; do ffmpeg -i "$f"  -acodec pcm_u8 -f u8 -ac 2 -ar 22375 -af aresample=22375:filter_size=256:cutoff=1.0  "${f%.wav}.raw" ; done
