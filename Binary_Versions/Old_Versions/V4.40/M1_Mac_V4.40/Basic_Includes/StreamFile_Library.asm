* Filename format info:
* This can include a full path name to the file
* You can use either a space-padded 11 character name or a traditional dot-separated name without padding

* Filenames must be 8 characters + a 3 character extension (no dot before the extension)
* If the filename is not 8 characters long then it must be padded with spaces
*
* Examples of the filename format:
* Name on the SD card is "TEST.TXT" needs to be accessed with the name 'm:TEST    TXT' or 'm:TEST.TXT'
* Name on the SD card is "CHECK123.BIN" needs to be accessed with the name 'm:CHECK123BIN'
* Name on the SD card is "HELLO.TXT" in a subfolder called "NEW" needs to be accessed with 'm:NEW/HELLO   TXT'
*
* Filename must be terminated with a zero.  The FCN command adds the zero when assembling
************************************************************************
* Open a file for streaming:
* Filename must be given with the full path on the SDC card
* The SDC calls the home directory m:
* X = location in memory for the full filename with a zero terminating the name (use FCN to add the trailing Zero), for example:
*
*  MountFile  FCN     'm:HEY12345JNK'
*
* Example code to use this library:
*
*  Code:
*       LDX     #MountFile                  * Point X at filename to stream
*       JSR     OpenSDC_File_X_At_Start     * Open a file on the SDC for streaming, 512 bytes at a time

* At this point, you can begin reading the data bytes from the port as 16 bit data at $FF4A & $FF4B.
* The MCU will continue to feed data to the port until EOF is reached or an abort command is issued ($D0).
* The busy bit in status will remain set until that time.
* You will have to poll for the ready bit between 512 byte sectors, as the MCU has to fill a buffer.
* However, using 6809 style transfer, it is able to pretty much keep up with the CPU.
* There is also a small wait you need built into the polling routines in order to give the MCU
* time to reset/set the bit (20 microseconds or so is sufficient).
