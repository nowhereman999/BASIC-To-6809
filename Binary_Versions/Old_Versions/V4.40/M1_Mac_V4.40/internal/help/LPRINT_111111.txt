The [[LPRINT]] statement sends string text or numerical values to a parallel port (LPT1) printer in QBasic or a USB printer in '''QB64'''.


{{PageSyntax}}
:[[LPRINT]] [{{Parameter|expression}}] [{;|,}]


{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|expression}} is one or more text or numerical expressions separated by a semi-colon (;) or comma (,).
* Syntax is the same as [[PRINT]], but cannot use a port number.
* Program does not have to [[OPEN]] the LPT1: parallel port.
* Assumes a 80 character wide page. '''[[Keywords currently not supported by QB64|WIDTH LPRINT is not supported in QB64.]]'''
* [[LPRINT USING]] can print formatted text data to a page identically to how [[PRINT USING]] formats a program screen.
* [[COLOR]]ed text and images can be printed using [[_PRINTIMAGE]] which stretches them to fit the default printer's paper size.
* LPRINT will only print to the default USB or LPT printer set up in Windows. '''[[Keywords currently not supported by QB64#Keywords_not_supported_in_Linux_or_macOS_versions|Keyword not supported in Linux or macOS versions]]'''.
* Note: Printer ''escape codes'' starting with [[CHR$]](27) will not work with LPRINT and may produce text printing errors.
