The '''STOP''' statement is used to stop program execution when troubleshooting a program or to suspend event trapping.


{{PageSyntax}}
: STOP


{{PageDescription}}
* STOP used in the QBasic IDE does not close any files or go to the operating system. It returns to the IDE.
* In the QB64 compiler, STOP closes the program window and returns to the IDE when the code is compiled from there.
* STOP is ONLY used for debugging purposes and should not be used to exit programs!
* STOP can also be used to suspend an event trap in the following statements: [[KEY(n)]], [[STRIG(n)]] and [[TIMER|TIMER(n)]]. The trap can be turned back on with [[ON]] and returns any trap events since '''STOP''' was used.
