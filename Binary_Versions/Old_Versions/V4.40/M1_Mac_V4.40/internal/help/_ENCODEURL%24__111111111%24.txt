{{DISPLAYTITLE:_ENCODEURL$}}
The '''_ENCODEURL$''' function returns the so called percent encoded representation of the given URL.


{{PageSyntax}}
: result$ = [[_ENCODEURL$]]({{Parameter|url$}})


{{PageParameters}}
* {{Parameter|url$}} is the URL to encode as variable or literal [[STRING]].


{{PageDescription}}
* URL encoding may be required before trying to retrieve it using the [[_OPENCLIENT|_OPENCLIENT("HTTP:url")]] command.
* Proper encoding is under the obligation of the application, because only that knows how the URL currently looks like and hence if encoding is required or not.
* This function performs the most simple encoding according to the informations [https://docs.mapp.com/docs/url-encoding-and-what-characters-are-valid-in-a-uri found here], which is sufficient for the most work cases.
** Chars - . _ ~ 0 to 9 Aa to Zz (not encoded).
** Chars # / : ? @ [ ] (not encoded in address part but encoded in query part, first ? is not encoded and starts the query part).
** Chars & = (not encoded as query key separator respectively query value assignment on a simple 1:1 swap base).
** Control chars, spaces and extended ASCII (>127) are always encoded, regardless in which part of the URL they are used.
** If the application uses unconventional URL notation, e.g. query parts like ''?foo=bar&baz&flip=true'' where the use of ampersands (&) or other reserved chars is ambigous, then it must implement its own custom encoding routine, as only the application knows the correct syntax in such cases.
* Note that this function performs no validation of the given URL, it expects a valid URL to be given and just does the encoding.
* Note also that it does not check, if the URL is already encoded. Although multiple times encoded URLs should not be a problem for most servers, it's recommended to avoid it.
