[[$LET]] is a precompiler [[Metacommand|metacommand]]. It is used to define or redefine precompiler variables for use in the [[$IF]]...[[$ELSE]]...[[$END IF]] block statements.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[$LET]] variable = value


{{PageDescription}}
* Unlike [[LET]], [[$LET]] is not optional.
* $LET a = 12 sets a precompiler variable "a" to the value of 12. This variable is only valid for the precompiler itself and does nothing to affect the values of any variable/constant which might also be called "a" in the program.
* Variable names must follow QB64's variable naming conventions. They will be capitalized automatically.
* Values may contain any number of periods to separate numbers or words in a string, e.g. in version numbers such as '''3.14.1''' or strings like '''MARY.HAD.A.LITTLE.LAMB''' etc..
** Note that strings may not contain spaces and therefore may be given without leading/trailing quotes.
* You can check a precompiler variable against special values '''DEFINED''' and '''UNDEFINED''', in order to assess whether the variable has already been assigned a value. Useful for code in libraries which may be repeated.
* The precompiler comes with some preset values which can be used to help determine which code blocks to include/exclude.  These are:
** '''WIN''' or '''WINDOWS''' is ''true(-1)'' if the user is running QB64 in a Windows environment, it is ''false(0)'' otherwise.
** '''LINUX''' is ''true(-1)'' if the user is running QB64 in a Linux environment, it is ''false(0)'' otherwise.
** '''MAC''' or '''MACOSX''' is ''true(-1)'' if the user is running QB64 in a macOS environment, it is ''false(0)'' otherwise.
** '''32BIT''' is ''true(-1)'' if the user is running a 32-bit version of QB64., it is ''false(0)'' otherwise.
** '''64BIT''' is ''true(-1)'' if the user is running a 64-bit version of QB64., it is ''false(0)'' otherwise.
** '''VERSION''', which is set to the version of the QB64 compiler.
* Some new presets have been introduced with QB64-PE v4.0.0, these are:
** '''_QB64PE_''' is always ''true(-1)'', it indicates the use of the QB64 Phoenix Edition compiler at least v4.0.0
** '''_ASSERTS_''' is ''one(1)'' if [[$ASSERTS]] or [[$ASSERTS|$ASSERTS:CONSOLE]] is used, it is ''zero(0)'' otherwise.
** '''_CONSOLE_''' is ''one(1)'' if a console is active either by using [[$CONSOLE]] directly or implied by [[$ASSERTS|$ASSERTS:CONSOLE]], it is ''two(2)'' if [[$CONSOLE|$CONSOLE:ONLY]] is set, it is ''zero(0)'' if no console is available (both console variants may appear multiple times in a program, the last found one determines the final state).
** '''_DEBUG_''' is ''one(1)'' if [[$DEBUG]] is used, it is ''zero(0)'' otherwise.
** '''_EXPLICIT_''' is ''one(1)'' if the program uses [[OPTION EXPLICIT|OPTION _EXPLICIT]], it is ''zero(0)'' otherwise (note OE also implies '''OPTION _EXPLICITARRAY''').
** '''_EXPLICITARRAY_''' is ''one(1)'' if the program uses [[OPTION EXPLICITARRAY|OPTION _EXPLICITARRAY]] or [[OPTION EXPLICIT|OPTION _EXPLICIT]], it is ''zero(0)'' otherwise.
; Important notes regarding the preset values
:* All presets are {{Text|'''read-only'''|red}} values and cannot be redefined by using [[$LET]] on it.
:* The presets shall just serve the ability, for library makers, to easily check what features are active in a program, they shall otherwise not be {{Text|'''misused to enforce'''|red}} certain features, e.g.
::* don't check for '''_CONSOLE_''' and force one to open, if none is there,
::* don't check for '''_EXPLICIT_''' and force it, if it's not in effect, etc.
:* Think of it like checking for '''WINDOWS''' and if it's not forcing the user to buy a Windows system or checking for '''32BIT''' and if it's not forcing the user to downgrade his 64-bit system. You wouldn't do that, right? And by that means you also should not enforce things, which the user did not already use in his program.
