{{DISPLAYTITLE:_CWD$}}

The [[_CWD$]] function returns the current working directory path as a string value without a trailing path separator (see also '''Availability''' below).


{{PageSyntax}}
: {{Parameter|workingDirectory$}} = [[_CWD$]]


{{PageDescription}}
* By default, the initial working directory path is usually the same as the directory of the executable file run.
* The current working directory can be changed with the [[CHDIR]] or [[SHELL]] command; CHDIR sets it, _CWD$ returns it.
* Path returns will change only when the working path has changed.  When in C:\ and run QB64\cwd.exe, it will still return C:\
* The current working directory string can be used in [[OPEN]] statements and [[SHELL]] commands that deal with files.
* Works in Windows, macOS and Linux. [[_OS$]] can be used by a program to predict the proper slash separations in different OS's.

=== Errors ===
* If an error occurs while obtaining the working directory from the operating system, [[ERROR Codes|error code]] 51 (Internal Error) will be generated.

* Since '''QB64-PE v4.1.0''' the path is always returned '''with''' a trailing path separator, hence you don't need to add it yourself anymore. The change was implemented to be in line with [[_DIR$]] and [[_FULLPATH$]].
** Old code, which is adding a separator, still works as all supported platforms were tested and proved they doesn't care about multiple consecutive path separators.


{{PageExamples}}
''Example:'' Get the current working directory, and move around the file system:
{{CodeStart}}
startdir$ = {{Cl|_CWD$}}
{{Cl|PRINT}} {{Text|<nowiki>"We started at "</nowiki>|#FFB100}}; startdir$
{{Cl|MKDIR}} {{Text|<nowiki>"a_temporary_dir"</nowiki>|#FFB100}}
{{Cl|CHDIR}} {{Text|<nowiki>"a_temporary_dir"</nowiki>|#FFB100}}
{{Cl|PRINT}} {{Text|<nowiki>"We are now in "</nowiki>|#FFB100}}; {{Cl|_CWD$}}
{{Cl|CHDIR}} startdir$
{{Cl|PRINT}} {{Text|<nowiki>"And now we're back in "</nowiki>|#FFB100}}; {{Cl|_CWD$}}
{{Cl|RMDIR}} {{Text|<nowiki>"a_temporary_dir"</nowiki>|#FFB100}}
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
We started at C:\QB64
We are now in C:\QB64\a_temporary_dir
And now we're back in C:\QB64
{{OutputEnd}}
