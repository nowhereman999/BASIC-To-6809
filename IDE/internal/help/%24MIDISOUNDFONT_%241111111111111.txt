The now {{Text|deprecated|red}} [[$MIDISOUNDFONT]] metacommand did enable MIDI support for [[_SNDOPEN]] in QB64-PE versions prior to v3.14.0, and was also considered unstable. It could only be used with the [[$UNSTABLE]]:MIDI flag set. Since v3.14.0 MIDI support is stable and you can use [[_MIDISOUNDBANK]] to load a soundfont.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[$MIDISOUNDFONT]]: {DEFAULT|"{{Parameter|Filename}}"}


{{PageParameters}}

{{PageDescription}}
* The use of this metacommand allows [[_SNDOPEN]] to open MIDI files.
