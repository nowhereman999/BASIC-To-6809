The '''SEEK''' function returns the byte or record position in a file, which is read or written next.


{{PageSyntax}}
: {{Parameter|byte}} = [[SEEK (function)|SEEK]]({{Parameter|filenumber&}})


{{PageParameters}}
* {{Parameter|filenumber&}} is the number of an [[OPEN]] file in any mode.
* In [[RANDOM]] files '''SEEK''' returns the record position to read or write.
* In [[BINARY]] or sequencial files '''SEEK''' returns the byte position to read or write (first byte = 1).
* Since the first file position is 1 it may require adding one to an offset value when documentation uses that position as 0.
* Devices that do not support SEEK (SCRN, CONS, KBRD, COMn and LPTn) return 0.

=== Notes ===
* Don't confuse the [[LOC]] position with the [[SEEK (function)|SEEK]] position !!
** '''LOC''' is the {{Text|last|red}} read or written byte or record prosition.
** '''SEEK''' is the byte or record prosition to read or write {{Text|next|red}}.

OPEN "readme.md" FOR BINARY AS #1

PRINT LOC(1) 'LOC returns 0, as we didn't read something yet
PRINT SEEK(1) 'SEEK otherwise returns 1, as it's the first byte to read

GET #1, , a& 'now let's read a LONG (4 bytes)

PRINT LOC(1) 'now LOC returns 4, the last read byte
PRINT SEEK(1) 'and SEEK returns 5 now, the next byte to read

CLOSE #1
