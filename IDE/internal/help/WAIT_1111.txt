The [[WAIT]] statement waits until the value read from an I/O port has certain bits set.


{{PageSyntax}}
:[[WAIT]] {{Parameter|port%}}, {{Parameter|andMask%}}[, {{Parameter|xorMask%}}]


{{PageDescription}}
* The [[WAIT]] statement reads a value from {{Parameter|port%}} using [[INP]].
* If {{Parameter|xorMask%}} is specified, the value is [[XOR]]'d with {{Parameter|xorMask%}}. It has the effect of "toggle these bits".
* The value is then [[AND]]'d with {{Parameter|andMask%}}. It has the effect of "check if these bits are set".
* If the final value is non-zero, [[WAIT]] returns. Otherwise, another value is read from {{Parameter|port%}} and checked again.
* The [[WAIT]] statement returns immediately if {{Parameter|port%}} is not supported.
