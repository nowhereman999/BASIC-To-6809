'''Metacommands''' are commands that start with '''dollar sign ($)'''. Those commands usually switch the program between different operation modes/behavior or provide extended functionality.

== Legacy Metacommands (QBasic/QuickBASIC) ==
:*Legacy metacommands are normally used at the program start, they should have their own program line and must be commented with an ''[[Apostrophe|&apos;]]'' or [[REM]].
* [[$DYNAMIC]] {{Text|set all program arrays as changeable in size using [[REDIM]].}}
* [[$INCLUDE]] {{Text|designates a text code library file to include with the program.}}
* [[$STATIC]] {{Text|set all program arrays as unchangeable in size using [[DIM]].}}
=== Legacy style, but QB64-PE only ===
* [[$FORMAT]] {{Text|controls the code formatting behavior in QB64-PE.}}


== QB64 Metacommands ==
:*QB64 metacommands must not necessarily used at the program start. However, it's still the best location for some of it (see individual descriptions).
:*QB64 metacommands must not be commented with an ''[[Apostrophe|&apos;]]'' or [[REM]], but should have their own program line too.
* [[$ASSERTS]] {{Text|enables debug tests with the [[_ASSERT]] macro.}}
* [[$CHECKING]] {{Text|turns event and error checking OFF or ON.}}
* [[$COLOR]] {{Text|includes named color name constants in a program.}}
* [[$CONSOLE]] {{Text|creates a console window that can be used throughout a program.}}
* [[$DEBUG]] {{Text|enables debugging features, allowing you to step through your code line by line.}}
* [[$EMBED]] {{Text|is used to embed any file's contents into the compiled executable. Recall the embedded file contents using [[_EMBEDDED$]].}}
* [[$EXEICON]] {{Text|is used with an .ICO icon file name to embed the image into the compiled executable.}}
* [[$INCLUDEONCE]] {{Text|prevents that include file contents is injected multiple times into a program.}}
* [[$MIDISOUNDFONT]] ({{Text|deprecated|red}}) {{Text|enables the MIDI support for [[_SNDOPEN]].}}
* [[$NOPREFIX]] ({{Text|deprecated|red}}) {{Text|allows QB64-specific keywords to be used without the underscore prefix.}}
* [[$RESIZE]] {{Text|used with ON allows a user to resize the program window where OFF does not.}}
* [[$SCREENHIDE]] {{Text|hides the program window from view.}}
* [[$SCREENSHOW]] {{Text|displays the program window after it was hidden.}}
* [[$UNSTABLE]] {{Text|will enable the use of features that have not yet been made a permanent part of the language.}}
* [[$VERSIONINFO]] {{Text|adds metadata to Windows only binaries for identification purposes across the OS.}}


== QB64 Precompiler Commands ==
:*These are a special type of ''{{Text|QB64 Metacommands|blue}}'', which allow for conditional compiling, hence including or excluding certain code sections depending on given conditions.
* [[$ELSE]] {{Text|used in conjunction with [[$IF]] for the precompiler.}}
* [[$ELSEIF]] {{Text|used in conjunction with [[$IF]] for the precompiler.}}
* [[$END IF]] {{Text|used in conjunction with [[$IF]] for the precompiler.}}
* [[$ERROR]] {{Text|used to trigger compiler errors from within the precompiling pass.}}
* [[$IF]] {{Text|used to set an [[IF]] condition for the precompiler.}}
* [[$LET]] {{Text|used to set a variable for the precompiler.}}
