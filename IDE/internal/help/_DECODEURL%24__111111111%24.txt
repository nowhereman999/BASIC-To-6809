{{DISPLAYTITLE:_DECODEURL$}}
The '''_DECODEURL$''' function is the counterpart for [[_ENCODEURL$]], it returns the decoded plain text URL of the given encoded URL.


{{PageSyntax}}
: result$ = [[_DECODEURL$]]({{Parameter|url$}})


{{PageParameters}}
* {{Parameter|url$}} is the URL to decode as variable or literal [[STRING]].


{{PageDescription}}
* URL decoding may be required when parsing [[Downloading Files|downloaded files]] for additional links and retrieving its addresses.
* It is safe to call this function with an unencoded URL, it will be simply returned as is.
* As it is possible, although not recommended, that a URL was encoded multiple times, this function can be called multiple times too until all encoded chars are resolved again, i.e. until the the given URL is returned unchanged as is.
* Note that this function performs no validation of the given URL, it expects a valid URL to be given and just does the decoding.
