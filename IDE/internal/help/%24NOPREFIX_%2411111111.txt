The now {{Text|deprecated|red}} [[$NOPREFIX]] metacommand did allow all QB64 functions and statements to be used without the leading underscore.


{{PageSyntax}}
:[[$NOPREFIX]]


{{PageDescription}}
* QB64-specific keywords are by default prefixed with an underscore, in order to differentiate them from legacy keywords inherited from QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5.
* The convention exists in order to allow older code to be loaded and compiled in QB64 without naming conflicts with existing variables or constants.
* If you are writing new code with QB64, and '''not importing code''' from QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5 nor any 3rd party .bi/.bm style libraries, then [[$NOPREFIX]] allows you to reduce typing by not having to use underscores in modern keywords.
;{{Text|!!! WARNING !!!|red}}
:* Do not use '''$NOPREFIX''' when working with old QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5 code or when your program depends on 3rd party library code, otherwise you risk a lot of {{Text|"Name already in use"|red}} syntax errors, as the old code or libraries may use variable, SUB or FUNCTION names which conflict with new QB64 keywords if they are not prefixed with an underscore.
:* Once again, use '''$NOPREFIX''' only with new written QB64 code which is fully under your control without any 3rd party dependencies!
* '''SUB _GL''' is an internal routine and must '''always''' be prefixed.
* When [[$NOPREFIX]] is used, QB64 keywords can be used both with or without the leading underscore, so that both [[_DISPLAY]] and [[_DISPLAY|DISPLAY]] are valid in the same program, for example.
* [[$NOPREFIX]] must be the first non-comment and non-whitespace line in a program.
** Since QB64 v2.0 (incl. all QB64-PE versions) [[$NOPREFIX]] can be placed anywhere in a program.

* '''$NOPREFIX''' was {{Text|deprecated|red}} in '''QB64-PE v4.0.0'''. However, as some concerns arised over the deprecation in our Forum, we decided to implement a converter which offers the automatic conversion of '''$NOPREFIX''' dependent code when trying to compile it.
