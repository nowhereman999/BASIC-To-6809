The [[$UNSTABLE]] metacommand is used to enable the use of features that have not yet been made a permanent part of the language. Features hidden behind this metacommand may have breaking changes or be removed between releases.


{{PageSyntax}}
:[[$UNSTABLE]]: {MIDI, HTTP}


{{PageParameters}}
* The current unstable features are as follows:
** '''MIDI''' allows usage of the [[$MIDISOUNDFONT]] metacommand ({{Text|no longer required|red}}, see Availability below)
** '''HTTP''' allows opening HTTP connections using [[_OPENCLIENT]] ({{Text|no longer required|red}}, see Availability below)


{{PageDescription}}
* [[$UNSTABLE]] exists as a way to allow usage of new language features before they are finalized as part of the language.
* Any languages features hidden behind [[$UNSTABLE]] may be changed in breaking ways in the next version of QB64-PE.
* Language features that become a permanent part of the language will no longer require [[$UNSTABLE]] to be used.
* More than one [[$UNSTABLE]] can be used in a program.
