{{DISPLAYTITLE:_DISPLAYORDER}}
The [[_DISPLAYORDER]] statement defines the order to render software, hardware and custom-OpenGL-code.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[_DISPLAYORDER]] [{_SOFTWARE|_HARDWARE|_HARDWARE1|_GLRENDER}][, ...][, ...][, ...][, ...]


{{PageParameters}}
* _SOFTWARE refers to software created surfaces or [[SCREEN]]s.
* _HARDWARE and _HARDWARE1 refer to surfaces created by OpenGL hardware acceleration.
* _GLRENDER refers to OpenGL code rendering order


{{PageDescription}}
* The default on program start is: _DISPLAYORDER _SOFTWARE, _HARDWARE, _GLRENDER, _HARDWARE1
* Any content or combination order is allowed, except listing the same content twice consecutively.
* Simply using [[_DISPLAYORDER]] _HARDWARE will render hardware surfaces only.
* Use an [[underscore]] to continue a code line on a new text row in the IDE.
* After _DISPLAYORDER has been used, it must be used to make any changes, even to default.

=== Errors ===
* If a rendering content is not listed it will not be rendered except when using the startup default.
* Rendering the same content twice consecutively in a combination is not allowed.
