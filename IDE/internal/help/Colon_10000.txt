A '''colon''' can be used to separate two unrelated procedure statements on the same line.


''Usage:'' COLOR 10: PRINT "Hello "; : COLOR 12: PRINT "World"

{{OutputStart}}
{{Text|Hello |limegreen}}{{Text|World|red}}
{{OutputEnd}}


* Use colons to combine variable definition statements or screen [[PRINT|prints]].
* Some statements such as [[END IF]] and [[Metacommand]]s require a new code line!
* Use [[Semicolon|semicolons]] and [[Comma|commas]] where appropriate in [[PRINT]]s.
* Use an [[underscore]] at the end of a line to extend a line of code to the next line.
