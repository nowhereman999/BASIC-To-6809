[[DEF SEG]] is used to define the area in memory to access QB64's emulated conventional memory.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[DEF SEG]] [=][{segment|VARSEG(variable}]

=== Legacy support ===
* '''QB64 implements memory access using [[_MEM]] and related functions. For that reason, [[DEF SEG]] isn't recommended practice anymore and is supported to maintain compatibility with legacy code.'''


{{PageDescription}}
* Used to set the pointer to a memory area of a variable/array or register.
* [[PEEK]] and [[POKE]] require a segment memory address (often just 0) without using VARSEG.
* Important segments using [[PEEK]] and [[POKE]] include &HB800 (text segment) and &HA000 (graphics segment).
* [[BSAVE]] and [[BLOAD]] require a VARSEG reference to the grahic array(0 index) used.
* Always use DEF SEG when the procedure is completed, in order to reset the segment to QBasic's default value.
* [[DEF SEG]], [[VARSEG]], [[VARPTR]], [[PEEK]] and [[POKE]] access QB64's emulated 16 bit conventional memory block. '''It is highly recommended to use QB64's [[_MEM]] memory system to avoid running out of memory.'''
