[[LET]] is a needless statement today. It was designed for the very early BASIC dialects to assign a value to a variable.


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[LET]] {{Parameter|variable}} = {{Parameter|expression}}


{{PageDescription}}
* {{InlineCode}}{{Cl|LET}} a = 12{{InlineCodeEnd}} is the very same as {{InlineCode}}a = 12{{InlineCodeEnd}}, but wastes 4 extra bytes of program space.
* That said, [[LET]] is '''optional''', it's the only keyword where the '''entire keyword''' is optional.ðŸ˜€
