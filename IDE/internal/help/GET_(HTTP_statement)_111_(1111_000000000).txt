'''GET''' reads the response of an HTTP request that was opened using [[_OPENCLIENT]].

{{Text|'''HTTP functionality is current unstable, and requires [[$UNSTABLE]]:HTTP to be able to use.'''|red}}


{{PageSyntax}}
: [[GET (HTTP statement)|GET]] #{{Parameter|Handle}}, , {{Parameter|String}}
: [[GET (HTTP statement)|GET]] #{{Parameter|Handle}}, , {{Parameter|Fixed-Length-Variable}}


{{PageParameters}}
* {{Parameter|Handle}} is the handle returned from [[_OPENCLIENT]] when making an HTTP request.
* {{Parameter|String}} is a regular [[STRING]] variable.
* {{Parameter|Fixed-Length-Variable}} is any variable with a type that has a fixed size.


{{PageDescription}}
'''GET''' is used to read the HTTP response data from an HTTP request opened using [[_OPENCLIENT]]. The preferred way to use this is by passing '''GET''' a variable-length [[STRING]] variable. The [[STRING]] variable will be resized to fit all the data currently available from the HTTP connection. '''GET''' should be called multiple times to receive all the data from the HTTP request. [[EOF]] should be used to check if there is more data left to '''GET''', when [[EOF]] returns true then the request is complete and all the data in the request response has been read via '''GET'''.

Another option is to use fixed-length variables with '''GET'''. This is not recommended as the behavior becomes more complex due to QB64-PE being unable to resize the provided variable to match the amount of data currently available from the connection. When using this version, the behavior of [[EOF]] will change to report an [[EOF]] if there is not enough data available from the connection to completely fill the variable provided to '''GET'''. You should make use of [[_CONNECTED]] to determine whether the [[EOF]] indicates the actual end of the HTTP response, as if the connection is no longer up then you can be sure no new data may be coming.
