{{PageDescription}}
* The '''BEEP''' statement can be used anywhere in the code to alert the user that there is something to attend to or an error has occurred.

* There used to be the ability to produce a beep by printing [[CHR$]](7) to the screen. This functionality was no longer available since '''QB64 v0.960''', when SDL audio was exchanged by OpenAL audio.
* In '''QB64-PE v4.0.0''' the beeping functionality using [[PRINT]] [[CHR$]](7) has been restored.
